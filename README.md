# consolelogger README

This is the README for the vs code extension "Console Logger". 

While debuggers are great I'm still a big fan of the humble console.log. This is a small vs code extension that will turn.
Highlight the code you want logged, hit Cmd+Shift+P, choose Console Logger and it runs.

This currently supports Javascript(console.log()) and Ruby (puts).
