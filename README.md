# consolelogger README

This is the README for the vs code extension "Console Logger". 

While debuggers are great I'm still a big fan of the humble console.log. This is a small vs code extension that will turn

```
coolVariable
```
into
```
console.log('coolVariable', coolVariable)
```

This currently supports Javascript(console.log()) and Ruby (puts).
